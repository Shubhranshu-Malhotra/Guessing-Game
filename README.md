# Guessing-Game
A simple game I created while learning python. A game to guess a number in a range and matching it with the random integer generated by the system.

**Need to pass two integer command line arguments**  
Argument 1: start  
Argument 2: end  
  
The random numbers will be created between {start} and {end} passed as command line arguments by user.
